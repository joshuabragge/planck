*2018-11-19*
- removed `~` from number layer.
- added `LEAD+L` = `GUI+L` and `LEAD+U` = `CTRL+ALT+DEL`.
- moved `ALT` over so it is more accessable with thumb for `ALT+TAB` combinations.
- added `HYPER` to right side of keyboard in a thumb accessable spot
- added `LEAD+f` to send string "from:" (for outlook)
- added `F2` to left hand. Will be able to rename files while selecting them with a mouse.
- added `RSHIFT` to where `ENTER` was and moved `ENTER` and `"` up.
- moved `GUI` to far right switching places with `-/_` and bringing it into ring finger location
- removed `=` and `-` from symbol layer.
- MASSIVE reorganization of the symbol layer.

Todo:
- Squeeze `=` into main layout?
- Double tap HYPER for window management layer?
